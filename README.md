# Assignment 03

**Real Time Application**

**Due Date: Week 13 - Midnight of 4/19/2017**
 The program was created from watching a tutorial by Daniel Shiffman,  Web Sockets and p5.js Tutorial.
 
 After running "nodemon" in terminal to start the server I accessed localhost:3000 in my chorme browser.
 a canvas square 400 x 400 appears in the upper left corner of the browser window.
 In this canvas you are able to draw in white when you press the mouse button and drag the mouse across the canvas.
 In terminal we can see the new socket.io connection when localhost was opened in chrome.
 In Safari a localhost:3000 connection was opened and it too, can be seen in termnial as a new connection.
 The program is set so that whatever is drawen in white will appear in red in the other socket connections.
